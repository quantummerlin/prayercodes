## The Vision

The Quantum Zip is a prayer tool that feels like it is directly connected to the Kingdom of Heaven — delivered by angels, sent by God, the all-encompassing energy of everything. Every piece of content generated by this system carries that reverence, that warmth, and that authority.

No data is collected. No payment is required. This is a free tool for believers to structure their prayers, encode them through sacred mathematics, and amplify their connection to the throne of grace.
