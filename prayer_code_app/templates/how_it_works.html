  <h2 class="text-center">How Prayer Codes Work</h2>
  
  <div class="scripture-quote">
    "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
    <div class="scripture-reference">Matthew 18:20 (KJV)</div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Prayer Codes combine the ancient wisdom of structured prayer with the power of numerical encoding to create a unique spiritual practice that strengthens your connection to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
  
  <h3>The Biblical Foundation</h3>
  <p>Throughout scripture, we see structured prayer as a powerful way to communicate with God. From the Lord's Prayer given by Jesus to the Psalms of David, the Bible provides us with templates for effective prayer.</p>
  
  <div class="scripture-quote">
    "After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name..."
    <div class="scripture-reference">Matthew 6:9-13 (KJV)</div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Prayer Codes helps you build prayers following these biblical structures, ensuring your prayers are aligned with God's Word.</p>
  
  <h3>The Power of English Gematria</h3>
  <p>Gematria is an ancient practice of assigning numerical values to letters. In English Gematria, A=1, B=2, C=3, and so on. When applied to prayers, this creates a unique numerical code that represents the essence of your prayer.</p>
  
  <div class="scripture-quote">
    "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."
    <div class="scripture-reference">Isaiah 55:11 (KJV)</div>
  </div>
  
  <p>Your Prayer Code becomes a concentrated form of your prayer intention, allowing you to carry and focus on your prayer throughout the day without having to recite the entire prayer.</p>
</div>

  <h2 class="text-center">The Prayer Code Process</h2>
  
  <div class="process-steps">
    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>1. Build Your Prayer</h3>
      <p>Select a prayer category based on your need (Protection, Thanksgiving, Petition, etc.) and follow the biblical structure to create a meaningful prayer.</p>
      <div class="scripture-quote">
        "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
        <div class="scripture-reference">Hebrews 4:16 (KJV)</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>2. Generate Your Code</h3>
      <p>Your prayer is converted into a unique numerical code using English Gematria. This code becomes a spiritual shorthand for your prayer.</p>
      <div class="scripture-quote">
        "He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names."
        <div class="scripture-reference">Psalm 147:4 (KJV)</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="process-step">
      <h3>3. Amplify Your Prayer</h3>
      <p>Strengthen your prayer by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sharing your code with others who can pray it with you</li>
        <li>Meditating on your code while listening to the 37-73 Hz creation frequency</li>
        <li>Writing your code in places where you'll see it throughout the day</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="scripture-quote">
        "Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven."
        <div class="scripture-reference">Matthew 18:19 (KJV)</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h2 class="text-center">The Creation Frequency (37-73 Hz)</h2>
  
  <p>The 37-73 Hz frequency range is known as the "Sound of Creation" - a powerful vibrational pattern that resonates with the divine creative energy that formed the universe.</p>
  
  <div class="scripture-quote">
    "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters."
    <div class="scripture-reference">Genesis 1:1-2 (KJV)</div>
  </div>
  
  <p>When you meditate on your Prayer Code while listening to this frequency, you align your prayer with the creative power of God, strengthening your connection to Heaven and amplifying your prayer's effectiveness.</p>
